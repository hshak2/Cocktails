# Cocktail Carousel
This is a page that allows you to search a cocktail or any type of drink and get the ingredients for it. Includes non-alcoholic drinks as well! Write the full name of the drink or just the first letter of the drink and get a full list of drinks you can choose from, including their ingredients. If you can't decide what to go for, click the randomize button to get a random drink.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I utilized a cocktails drink API and used a simple CSS design for my background. I had difficulty making the carousel effect and had to repeatedly come back to it multiple times to make it work.


## Lessons Learned:

The carousel effect was my biggest lesson learned. I tried researching multiple different ways to have this effect populated in the final product because I knew I wanted to give the option for users to see multiple drinks on a page as opposed to just one. I'm happy with how it turned out and glad that I was able to complete it successfully. There are still some quirks that need to be ironed out, but overall I am happy with the overall product.
